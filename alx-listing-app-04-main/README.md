# 🏡 ALX Listing App

Welcome to the **ALX Listing App**, a modern web application built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This project is part of a hands-on initiative to design and develop an **Airbnb-style property listing page**, focusing on clean architecture, reusable components, and scalable UI practices.

---

## ✨ Project Goal

The goal of the ALX Listing App is to:

- Recreate a **responsive property listing interface** inspired by Airbnb.
- Leverage **Next.js (Pages Router)** to structure the application effectively.
- Apply **TypeScript** to enforce type safety and code maintainability.
- Utilize **Tailwind CSS** to build fast, modern, mobile-first UI layouts.
- Structure the codebase for future expansion with components, constants, and assets.
